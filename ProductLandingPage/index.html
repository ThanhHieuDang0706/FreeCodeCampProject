    <p>More and more players want the playing comfort of a smaller acoustic guitar without having to sacrifice tone. So Taylor master builder Andy Powers set out to design a new guitar that could deliver on both fronts — combining the inviting feel of a compact instrument with the rich voice of a full-size, all-solid-wood guitar.

    <p>Designed from the ground up, the new Taylor GT™ (short for Grand Theater) introduces a new category of acoustic guitar in size, feel and sound. Crafted on Taylor’s California campus, the GT’s uniquely modern proportions make it super fun and easy to play, with a big sonic personality worthy of any pro player’s toolbox.</p>
    
    <h3>A Compact Body</h3>
    
    <p>The new GT body style borrows the basic body curves of our Grand Orchestra (our largest body style), but they’re scaled down for comfort. The width at the lower bout is nearly the same as the Taylor Grand Concert, but the GT’s body length is shorter and the body depth is slightly reduced. This creates an accessible feel for all types of players and scenarios, from the couch to the campfire to the concert hall.</p>

    </figure>
    
    
    <h3>A Compact Body</h3>
    <p>The GT’s unique neck proportions are also scaled for the ultimate in playing comfort. The 24-1/8-inch scale length lies between our GS Mini and the Grand Concert. The result is light string tension — the same as if you tuned a guitar with a 25-1/2-inch scale length down a half step. The closer fret spacing will help your fret-hand dexterity, while the string spacing at the nut (1-23/32”) finds the sweet spot between 1-11/16” and 1-3/4”.</p>

    <h3>Rich, Robust Sound</h3>    

    <p>Featuring all-solid-wood construction, the GT belies its size with a high-octane musical response. The secret sauce is our new C-Class™ voicing architecture inside the guitar. Inspired by our acclaimed V-Class® bracing, the C-Class design enhances the volume and sustain, while its unique asymmetrical pattern accentuates the lower frequencies. This allows the GT to produce a surprisingly warm bass response for its compact dimensions. The sound is sweet, focused and responsive — perfect for recording or plugging in with our ES2 pickup.</p>

    <h2>GTe Urban Ash | Urban Ash + Spruce</h2>
    <p>The first pair of acoustic guitars released with the new GT body shape features the GTe Urban Ash and its all-acoustic counterpart. Made with backs and sides of solid Urban Ash responsibly sourced from Shamel ash trees in need of removal from California municipal areas, these models generate a punchy midrange voice balanced with crisp highs and a rich low end boosted by our new C-Class bracing, developed specifically for the GT body shape. A solid spruce top rounds out the body and adds overall articulation, while the built-in ES2 pickup and preamp provide faithful sound for amplified situations and recording sessions.</p>

    <h2>GT 811e | Indian Rosewood + Spruce</h2>    
    
    <p>New for 2021, the GT 811e represents the first integration of the GT acoustic guitar body shape into the whole of the Taylor line. Like its siblings in the 800 Series, the GT 811e features solid East Indian rosewood back and sides paired with a solid Sitka spruce top. Under the hood, C-Class bracing produces impressive low-end power, volume and sustain for the compact proportions. The resulting tone sings with warmth and high-end clarity around a slightly scooped midrange that leaves a sweet spot open for vocals and other instruments. Rosewood’s famously high-fidelity response is on display here whether you’re recording acoustic tracks, practicing with your band, or just strumming on the couch, blending versatile musical character with an intimate, player-focused handfeel. Aesthetically, this model shares appointment details with the rest of the 800 Series, including mother-of-pearl fretboard and peghead inlays along with a 4.5-mil gloss-finish.</p>

    <h2>GT K21e | Hawaiian Koa</h2>    
    
    <p>Hawaiian koa imbues any acoustic guitar with a distinctively vibrant sound and a striking visual aesthetic to match. The GT K21e, the first Grand Theater guitar to feature the popular hardwood, further elevates koa’s musical reputation with a punchy midrange, clear treble chime, and a pleasing sonic sweetness. Offering some of the natural compression that players expect from mahogany, the koa top helps even out an aggressive attack and adds an extra splash of low-end presence. Voiced with C-Class bracing, the GT K21e offers surprising power from a smaller-bodied guitar, with plenty of volume and articulation to shine through any mix of sounds. Visually, this model echoes the styling of its Koa Series brethren with a sinuous Spring Vine inlay in maple and an edgeburst finish treatment to showcase koa’s naturally beautiful lustre and coloration.</p>
